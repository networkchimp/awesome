# Awesome Cloudflare Workers

[![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

A curated list of awesome articles & code for [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/).  They are similar to [browsers' Service Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API), but in the cloud--flare.

Inspired by the [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) list.  (A bit different, since the CSV dump contains many other links that didn't make the 'awesome' list.)
